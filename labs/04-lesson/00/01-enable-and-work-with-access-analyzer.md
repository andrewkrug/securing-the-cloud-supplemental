# Enable and Work with Access Analyzer

In this lab you will enable access analyzer and learn to work with ( triage ) some of the findings.

## Lab Instructions

1. In the root account ( unfederatedadministrator ) role using the console visit the IAM product.
2. Click access analyzer on the left and enable at least one analyzer.
3. Wait for the findings to roll in.  Click through a finding.  Is the triage data you're getting useful?  Archive the finding at the end.
4. Is there a class of resources in your account that should always be public?  Create an archive rule to make sure that you spare the human eyes on glass time.
