# Python Security Automation Lab

In this lab you'll create a DIY security automation using python.  Choose a CloudWatch event trigger, write some code, and test it out.  Optionally feel free to publish your template as GIST on github and share it back with the class.

## Lab Instructions

1. Use the web UI to string together a cloudwatch event, a lambda function, and an IAM role to do a thing.  Usually the classic example is enable cloudtrail if it's stopped.  But we can do better.  Think about security groups and open ACLs.
2. Use the Cloud9 editor to iterate and test.
3. Profit.

> Note: This is super super exploratory.  The more basic your automation the better.
